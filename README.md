<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## Why Pawfect?

In a world marred by 'Tyranny of choice', unsustainable discounts, similar looking mass produced products, and mechanical shopping, Pawfect is like a breath of fresh air. We bring the joy, emotions, and serendipity back in your shopping.

Adapting to the perpetually changing technological and dimensional needs of the customers, Pawfect is meant to celebrate the love for dogs and our respect for those who treat their dogs well. At Pawfect, we believe that pets are family. And family deserves only the best.

Our E-Commerce platform includes specialty items like treats and toys, shampoos and grooming accessories; we are also heavy into health products which include multi-vitamins and supplements for all aspects of your furry friend's health and well-being from teeth to tail. Sniff around and you'll find what you're after! Our goal has been and will continue to be to provide top quality, non prescription vet products while engaging our customers with the best customer service and prices!
